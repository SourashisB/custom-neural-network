# Build-Your-Own-Neural-Net (Python + NumPy/Pandas)

A step-by-step project to implement a minimal yet extensible neural network from scratch using only base Python and NumPy/Pandas.


# Project Goals

1. Implement core neural network components from scratch:

    a. Tensors, layers (Dense), activations, losses, optimizers, initializers

    b. Forward and backward propagation with autodiff-free manual gradients

    c. Training loop with batching, metrics, and simple logging

2. Provide simple but extensible API to build models

3. Reproducible experiments on small datasets
